/**
 * Audits a whole table column on the queue, in chunks, and caches the report.
 *
 * ```php
 * AuditPhoneColumn::dispatch(User::class, 'phone', country: 'KE', key: 'users');
 *
 * // …later
 * Cache::get('laranail.phone.audit.users');
 * ```
 *
 * ## Why the job takes a model class rather than the rows
 *
 * A queue payload has to serialise, and a generator does not. Neither does a closure, a database
 * cursor or an open file handle — which rules out every shape that makes streaming work in-process.
 * So the job carries a *description* of the source and opens it on the worker: a class name, a
 * column, and an optional named scope.
 *
 * The alternative — passing the rows in — reintroduces the problem the job exists to solve, since a
 * million values would have to be serialised into the payload before a worker ever saw one.
 *
 * ## One stream, not a merge per chunk
 *
 * `lazyById()` pages the query by primary key and yields models one at a time, so the whole column
 * reaches {@see PhoneBatch::report()} as a **single** sequence. That matters for more than tidiness:
 * the batch numbers entries from zero as it consumes them, so auditing chunk-by-chunk and merging
 * the reports afterwards would give every chunk its own indexes starting at 0 — the duplicate groups
 * would collide across chunks and report rows as duplicates of each other that are nothing of the
 * kind. Streaming once removes the failure rather than compensating for it.
 *
 * Keyset paging rather than `offset`, because an audit whose caller is also writing to the table it
 * reads — a de-duplication pass, say — shifts rows underneath an offset-paged query and silently
 * skips some.
 *
 * ## Memory
 *
 * O(distinct) in the numbers seen, not O(rows): the accumulator holds tallies and the first index
 * per number, never the entries. A million-row column of a few thousand distinct numbers costs the
 * few thousand. That is the whole reason {@see PhoneAuditReport} exists separately from the audit.
